# EleNA : Elevation based Navigation


### Description

---
Existing navigation systems optimize for the shortest or fastest route. 
However, they do not consider elevation gain. 
Letâ€™s say you are hiking or biking from one location to another. 
You may want to literally go the extra mile if that saves you a couple thousand feet in elevation gain. 
Likewise, you may want to maximize elevation gain if you are looking for an intense yet time-constrained workout.


For more about the architecture and evaluation, read [this](EleNa/README.MD)!


### Setup/Installation Instructions

----

At the time this project was built, the following were the system specifications:

|Tool/Package|Version||
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Python |3.8.6||
|Conda |4.9.0||
|Flask|1.1.2|`flask`, `flask-wtf`|
|Werkzeug|1.0.1||
|OpenStreetMap API|0.16.1|`osmnx`|
|GoogleMaps API|4.4.2|`googlemaps`|
|PyTest|6.1.2|`pytest`|
|PDoc3|0.9.1|`pdoc3`|


Setup a new environment using the conda/venv package managers.
We show how to create an environment using conda:

```shell script
conda create --name elena python=3.8.6
```

This environment can now be activated by:
```shell script
conda activate elena
```

Install the following packages:
- [osmnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation)
- [googlemaps](https://pypi.org/project/googlemaps/)
- [scipy](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/)
- [flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
- [flask-googlemaps](https://flask-googlemaps.com/installation/)
- [flask-wtf](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)

### Running the app

---

Before running the app, make sure the `PYTHONPATH` is set to the root directory of the project.

Access [this](EleNa/scripts) folder for triggering the scripts to run the Flask API.
From the root folder of the repository, run:

```shell script
cd EleNa/scripts
```

For Linux/Unix systems, 

```shell script
./RunElenaApp.sh
``` 

For Windows systems,

```shell script
./RunElenaApp.bat
```

Then follow the on-screen instructions to open the specified URL on a web browser to run the web application.

### Running the Tests

---

PyTest is used to automate the testing process. 
Please read [this](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contents.html#toc) to understand its usage.

From the [src](EleNa/src) folder, execute the following to build and run the tests.

```shell script
pytest
```

### Generating the documentation

---

[PyDoc3](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/) is used to run the documentation service.

The generated documentation of the code can be accessed [here](EleNa/docs/README.md) or in [HTML](EleNa/docs/documentation/EleNa/)

Run the below to generate the documentation from the source code.

```shell script
pdoc --html EleNa --output-dir documentation
```
