# EleNA : Elevation based Navigation
====

### Description

---
Existing navigation systems optimize for the shortest or fastest route. 
However, they do not consider elevation gain. 
Letâ€™s say you are hiking or biking from one location to another. 
You may want to literally go the extra mile if that saves you a couple thousand feet in elevation gain. 
Likewise, you may want to maximize elevation gain if you are looking for an intense yet time-constrained workout.


For more about the architecture and evaluation, read [this](EleNa/README.MD)!


### Setup/Installation Instructions

----

At the time this project was built, the following were the system specifications:

|Tool/Package|Version||
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Python |3.8.6||
|Conda |4.9.0||
|Flask|1.1.2|`flask`, `flask-wtf`|
|Werkzeug|1.0.1||
|OpenStreetMap API|0.16.1|`osmnx`|
|GoogleMaps API|4.4.2|`googlemaps`|
|PyTest|6.1.2|`pytest`|


Setup a new environment using the conda/venv package managers.
We show how to create an environment using conda:

```shell script
conda create --name elena python=3.5
```

This environment can now be activated by:
```shell script
conda activate elena
```

Install the required packages from the [requirements file](EleNa/docs/requirements.txt)

```shell script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
