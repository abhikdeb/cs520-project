# EleNA : Elevation based Navigation

### Description

Existing navigation systems optimize for the shortest or fastest route. 
However, they do not consider elevation gain. 
Letâ€™s say you are hiking or biking from one location to another. 
You may want to literally go the extra mile if that saves you a couple thousand feet in elevation gain. 
Likewise, you may want to maximize elevation gain if you are looking for an intense yet time-constrained workout.
