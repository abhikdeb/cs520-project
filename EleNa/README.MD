# EleNA : Elevation based Navigation

### Description

Existing navigation systems optimize for the shortest or fastest route. 
However, they do not consider elevation gain. 
Letâ€™s say you are hiking or biking from one location to another. 
You may want to literally go the extra mile if that saves you a couple thousand feet in elevation gain. 
Likewise, you may want to maximize elevation gain if you are looking for an intense yet time-constrained workout.


Given a start and an end location, a route that maximizes or minimizes elevation gain, 
while limiting the total distance between the two locations to x% of the shortest path.

### Evaluation
#### Quantitative evaluation
[This](https://github.com/abhikdeb/cs520-project/blob/e3c0245709bdfb7268acf376be080052d0709600/EleNa/src/test/test_x_percent.py#L1) is the primary evaluation module.
The evaluation primarily does the following:
- Instantiates Google Directions Service for querying ground-truth
- Randomly samples 50-100 data points (both source and destination) from OSMNX's Amherst map
- For each pair of source and destination:
  - Computes EleNa route for maximization task (using 200% as the maximum deviation from ground-truth)
  - Computes EleNa route for minimization task (using 200% as the maximum deviation from ground-truth)
  - Queries ground-truth using Google Directions service
  
- Verifies that the routes returned by EleNa (for both minimization/maximization tasks) are within x% of the ground-truth, for each of the data-points
- Generates plots (using matplotlib.pyplot) for:
  - Elevation gain in routes computed by EleNa (for both minimization/maximization tasks) against the elevation in the ground-truth route
  - percentage deviation of distance in routes computed by EleNa compared to ground-truth

Here are the plots following the evaluation of EleNa:
![Plot 1](https://github.com/abhikdeb/cs520-project/blob/dev/EleNa/images/elevation_plot.png)
![Plot 2](https://github.com/abhikdeb/cs520-project/blob/dev/EleNa/images/percentage_deviation_plot.png)

The first plot shows the results for 50 data-points (both maximization and minimization task) - we see that EleNa performs quite well in both the maximization and minimization tasks. For maximization task, routes computed by EleNa result in an average elevation gain of ~8 meters. However, EleNa seems to perform, on average, better in the elevation minimizsation task, with ~15 meters reduction in elevation compared to the ground-truth.

The second plot shows the percentage deviation of distance in EleNa routes compared to the ground-truth, for the same 50 data-points that we used in the first plot, but with a constraint of x=150%. It is clear from the plot that routes computed by EleNa do not exceed 150% of the ground truth distance, for both the maximization and minimization task.

#### Visual evaluation
The above module aids with a "qualitative" evalution of EleNa. However, a picture is worth a thousand words. For this reason, we decided to render the ground-truth path (queried using Google's Directions Service) alongside EleNa routes on the primary UI. For this purpose, we wrote the https://github.com/abhikdeb/cs520-project/blob/f5366f9908c9d8d289ede36ece03ae79ecad1681/EleNa/src/app/data_model/shortest_path.py#L117 API that computes the waypoints for the ground-truth route between any two points in the map. These waypoints are then rendered on the map in the main UI of EleNa, aiding the user to "visually" evaluate how EleNa performs.
