# EleNA : Elevation based Navigation

### Description

Existing navigation systems optimize for the shortest or fastest route. 
However, they do not consider elevation gain. 
Letâ€™s say you are hiking or biking from one location to another. 
You may want to literally go the extra mile if that saves you a couple thousand feet in elevation gain. 
Likewise, you may want to maximize elevation gain if you are looking for an intense yet time-constrained workout.


Given a start and an end location, a route that maximizes or minimizes elevation gain, 
while limiting the total distance between the two locations to x% of the shortest path.

4. Rendering the computed output

### Components

1. DATA - Region graph (GoogleMaps/OpenStreetMap)
2. Query/Extract from graph

--------------------------------------------------------


- UI -> Inputs: start, end, x%, elevetion(Min/Max); Output: Maps
- Geocoding Inputs () - searchable Inputs
- Routing Algo (Graph, input_params) - A-Star, Djikstras, Heuristics
- Render output path on Map and provide summary

### Architecture

1. Decoupled approach
  - Web UI Server
  - Back end service


2. Combined approach
  - Entire Web framework
